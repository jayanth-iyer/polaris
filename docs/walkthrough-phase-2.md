# Walkthrough - Phase 2: Kubernetes Orchestration & Strimzi Integration

I have successfully implemented the second phase of the Polaris project. 

## Accomplishments
- **Backend**: Integrated `kube-rs`, defined Strimzi CRDs, and implemented the provisioning workflow.
- **API**: Updated the gRPC server to handle cluster creation via Kubernetes.
- **Frontend**: Built a modern dashboard and cluster listing UI using Tailwind v4.

## Next Steps
In Phase 3, we will integrate Temporal for stateful workflows and implement scaling/upgrades.
