# Walkthrough: Polaris UI Design Phase

In this phase, I have designed the Polaris UI based on the self-hosted Kafka infrastructure requirements.

## Accomplishments
- **UI Design Document**: Created [polaris-ui-design.md](docs/polaris-ui-design.md) which defines:
    - Information Architecture (Inventory, Clusters, Workflows, Infrastructure).
    - Visual Identity (Polaris Night theme).
    - Core UI Views (Fleet Overview, Cluster Detail, Provisioning Wizard).
    - Real-time interaction model using SSE/WebSockets.
- **Project Integration**: 
    - Updated [README.md](README.md) to link to the new UI design.
    - Updated [design-doc.md](docs/design-doc.md) to include a reference to the detailed UI design.

## Design Highlights
- **Fleet Overview**: A "single pane of glass" for multi-cloud Kafka deployments.
- **Workflow Tracking**: First-class support for monitoring long-running Temporal operations.
- **High-Contrast Dark Theme**: Optimized for SREs and Platform Engineers working in various lighting conditions.

## Verification
- Verified that all links are correct.
- Verified that Mermaid diagrams in the design document are valid.
